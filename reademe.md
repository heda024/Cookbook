RECIPE WEBSITE

My final project is a recipe website. I have used firebase authentication to allow users to log in/sign up to access the website. From the homepage you can either search for recipes, or browse them by choosing categories. From there, you can click any recipe name which will make a modal pop up to show you the details of the recipe like ingredients and instructins. In the navbar there is also a sign out button and a link to a contact form where users can send in ideas for new recipes to add to the website.
